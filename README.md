# Into the Breach - Translations
Inofficial Translations for PC Game Into the Breach. This is all fan made. You can help translating this game into your language. If used, it does directly modify some game files.

Until now, a complete translation file for one language contains more than 5000 lines of text. Half of the lines are really long sentences, it's a text-heavy game. So, if you really start translating, it will probably take weeks of hard work to get it done.

## Support me
The work on the tools and everything to get this thing ready for real translators is hard, also myself have done the german translation. This already required many many work, so if you like to buy some coffee, to keep my eyes open, i will appriciate it. You can do this on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/brainfoolong) or via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/brainfoolong). Nonetheless, many hours of hard work have been done by the translators itself. So if you have spare money, support them as well. Checkout all forks for the contribution list.

## General Status
* Text-file based translation keys are complete, somewhat, and ready for translation
* The fonts of the game don't support most of special chars in other languages, a fix is probably to modify the included game fonts
* Hardcoded image translations are not changable by this tool as it requires to modify images directly out of game resources
