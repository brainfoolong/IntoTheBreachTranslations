He's come a long way from the wide-eyed soldier he first was (it seems like several lifetimes ago, and it was), and he tries to avoid attachments to the other pilots, as he knows how likely they are to die in battle. He has never said which island he hails from, and there are suspicions he may have come from somewhere beyond the Corporate archipelago... possibly even from a space station. If true, Ralph has refused to confirm it, although in a few timelines, both Bethany, Harold, and Isaac have commented on the Time Pod's architecture as being modeled off of space-faring tech (notably a launch capsule of a rocket... or an escape pod of a rocket).",

Abe served as an \"expeditor\" (assassin and \"black box\" work) during the early years of CEO Kern's rise to power, and he took on many names and identities in service to R.S.T. to handle any \"difficult issues\" that would arise that needed to be dealt with by the corporation. He is ruthless when given an objective (in this case, fighting the Vek), and served as ground support in his original timeline before stealing a Mech from a dying (?) pilot and using its breach technology to escape the timeline after the squad perished in the volcanic island. Since then, \"Abe\" has followed the orders of his first CEO Kern and is determined to keep fighting until every Vek in every timeline is defeated... a hopeless task, but \"Abe\" realizes he has little else to fight for, and even if he were to remain in a timeline he saved, he could not deal with the idea that other timelines were still in jeopardy. He has yet to encounter his duplicate, and if so, he may not recognize them due to surgery and the fluctuation of identities his job required before the Vek attack.",

He finds humans uncomfortable and confusing, and takes solace in tinkering with robotics and machines who have clear rulesets and reasons for what they do. In his original timeline, he served a brief term at Detritus (where he seemed bored and uncommunicative), then was rejected from Pinnacle due to his psychological exam, then found a home in Archive, studying and doing restoration work on Old Earth robotics. He initially applied to Archive's open-call for pilot training so it could get him closer to the Mech technology, then it was discovered he did well on the pilot exam (better than most Archive volunteers), and he agreed to serve as a soldier as a way of giving him access to the cutting edge of Mech technology. (Note that Harold doesn't bear any ill-will toward Detritus and Pinnacle, nor do they bear him any ill-will... however, both Singh's predecessor and Zenith saw Harold's lack of empathy, and were worried it could lead to accidents or disregard for human life while he was carrying out his duties.)",

Its job was to monitor region safety in Detritus disposal sites, but was severely damaged in a disposal accident (this was in the days before Vikram was CEO). The \"recycled recycler\" robot was sold at a discount to Archive as a groundskeeper for some of the nature preserves, and it seemed to take to the work, translating its knowledge of chemistry and recycling technology to help cultivate gardens (and when it wasn't able to do this, it would devour all books on botany, biology, and even spiritual books related to nurturing and growing of all life forms). It would have likely have remained a quiet hulking gardener were it not for the emergence of the Vek. When the Vek erupted on Archive, the robot followed its directives to protect the nature preserves… and saw the Vek as nothing more than garden pests to be eliminated to protect the plants. When Archive was able to send reinforcements to the region, they found Prospero still quietly tending its garden, now fertilized with Vek corpses. \n\nMuch like Gana, Prospero is viewed with some suspicion due to the robot uprising, but like Gana, Prospero follows orders and has proven itself on many occasions. When traversing to a new timeline, Prospero seems to actively avoid returning to Detritus. The reason for this is unknown.",

Lily was only newly-employed at Archive before she answered the open call for pilot training - some employees may have frowned at her sudden shift in career were it not for the urgency to find soldiers to fight the Vek. Unlike others at Archive who wished to slowly tinker with the Mechs, she embraced her training whole-heartedly, soon learning to use the Mech with one of the fastest training times of any Archive pilot on record. Lily's gone through only a few timelines (or maybe just one) and even seeing the end of the world hasn't dulled her enthusiasm for stopping the Vek.

It is believed this gave him considerable skill in tactics that was recognized during the open call for pilots when the Vek first attacked.

While hardly the most modest employee at Detritus, his accomplishments in battle have only fed his ego. Despite the timelines lost, Henry seems to see it all as some sort of game, and remains distant from the actual suffering - some suspect his jokes and boasting are a psychological shield, and thus, are afraid to pierce it, in case he loses what gives him his fighting confidence in the first place by dwelling on his failures vs. his accomplishments.",

She is a ex-cartographer and meteorological scout from R.S.T. - she was previously assigned to do field surveys and do \"terrain testing\" in areas where the corporation were testing out new terraforming weapons (she was essentially terraforming \"Q.A.\"). In this role, she became an excellent pilot (the others are dead, it's an unforgiving job) and developed a \"sixth sense\" for piloting craft in hazardous conditions and trusting her instincts to \"move\" whenever she sensed a quake or collapse in the ground was about to occur. She has since channeled this sixth sense into combat, learning to anticipate and evade Vek webs as well as knowing how to pilot her Mech in the thickest dust storms without handicapping her combat efficiency. She was one of the first volunteers to fight the Vek in her original timeline after the death of her adopted mother, and also (she's never revealed this to anyone else) she has always had a loathing for insects, so she takes satisfaction in wiping out the giant varieties (the Vek).",

This has had… partial success, and what happened to Gana is evidence as to why he was the only construction robot so outfitted: while an excellent soldier, his expressions and outlook are a blend of construction-focused speech mixed with ruthless pragmatism. As an example, Gana may categorize an otherwise simple repair as \"offending parts have been executed\" - or he may start ordering a building's infrastructure to \"hold the line\" to prevent a collapse. Soldiers who have served with Gana for an extended period of time have come to ignore its unusual speech patterns as the robot is incredibly effective on the field (and obeys orders), but Gana can be disconcerting for new pilots. Gana has indicated that when the war with the Vek is over, he would prefer to return to his construction duties, and finds he experiences \"reduced job satisfaction\" in fighting the Vek. \n\nNote that given the recent rise in prejudice against the Pinnacle robots, Gana has suffered similar discrimination… and several officers have questioned if Gana's \"sanity\" in case he may malfunction like the Pinnacle robots.",

He feels ill-suited for being a soldier (his squad mates usually agree, but his scientific knowledge is indispensable). \n\nWhile he and Bethany are technically brother and sister, there hasn't been a timeline where they both were alive to realize this (either Bethany dies at a young age, or Isaac dies - only one of them could be saved in the womb b/c of a chronic medical condition their parents had).

Kazaaakpleth is a secret pilot that can be gained over the course of the game.\n\nGeneral Background: The Mantis exist to expand, loot, and plunder. There are males and females of the species. They once enslaved the Engi (and thus, may have an overseer-like dominance toward their Mech). They are expansionist, tribal, warlike, and polytheistic. Females often don't make it to high positions of authority unless they are particularly vicious.\n\nThe Mantis at key points in their life, have to either return home to reform their exoskeletons (non-biological materials adhere to a resin secreted by their epidermal layers) - or to a suitable planet with the same materials. The Earth of Into the Breach is one such planet although it's not clear if the Mantis were aware of that. Their ships are also composed of the same crust as the Mantis \"wear.\" Presumably this crust can be applied to Mech hulls as well (not planning to discuss/show in game, merely commenting this). Mantis ship hulls may also be bedecked with hides, corpses, and remains of their kills. The Mantis enjoy teleporter technology in hunting prey (teleporting onto ships) and are comfortable with the technology (but the Breach tech may be more primitive than they're used to).\n\nSpecific Background: Kazaaakpleth is feared among his own people because he doesn't hunt aliens... he prefers to hunt his own kind. He outwardly claims to be doing this for bounties and for a higher, noble purpose, but secretly, he enjoys killing other Mantis. His craft is an escape pod from a failed encounter with a tribe of his own people he'd marked for death. His craft detected the beacon from Earth, and followed it to the corporate islands. He soon relalized he'd come to the \"Happy Hunting Grounds\" a place where he can practice his fighting skills on larger varities of insects than ever (the Vek) and a machine (his Mech) that he can use as a weapon. Kazaaakpleth is happy to slay as many Vek as he can, although if he had the skill to build a ship and take to the stars with the technology he has found, he would do so. Like Mantis, do, K. needs to reestablish his carapace, and he finds the islands rich with suitable biological material - including Vek corpses.",
